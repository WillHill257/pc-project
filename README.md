## Project Structure

This project consists of two parts: **Conway's Game of Life** and **Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm**.

Both parts consist of a serial implementation and a parallel implementation, where the correctness of the parallel implementation is validated against the output of the serial implementation for the same input.

_Further information about each part's strucutre and running instructions will be found in the corresponding directory_
